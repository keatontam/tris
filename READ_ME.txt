Please do all the following before attempting to run the game.

Setup Notes:
1. Go to the link below and download all of the game's assets
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Rt2-ZWoYuCMdCxyPQ4p7dl78H0udm0Fy?usp=sharing 
2. place 'fonts', 'images', and 'music' into the same directory as the .py files here
3. If it is your first time playing. Please be sure there is no existing file called "records.txt"
   as this will crash the game. records is an important file for loading up the game as it is essentially
   your save file. When the game loads the first time, it will create a records.txt that will be used from
   then on and will keep track of your progress through the game.
4. That's it! go ahead and run TrisApplet.py to load up the game! Please be sure you have pygame installed.
